Group project 1
Our project is basically a choose your superhero based on your field text game. It includes inputs and if/then statements that give the interactive nature of a classic text based game.
List of characters by discipline:
computing and IT= Cyborg
Science = The Hulk/ Bruce Banner
Engineering = Iron Man
Health Sciences = Capitan America
# Background Research
# As we examine the role of Artificial intelligence in academic and career planning, it is important to understand the steps that AI projects take to make a functional AI for use in the academic world. The first step when creating an AI is to determine the objectives that the AI should strive to achieve. For example, in the article A MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM FOR UNIVERSITY COURSE TIMETABLING, the authors are attempting to apply AI to the time management portion of academics. On the other hand, projects such as the one described in Building an Efficient Artificial Intelligence Model for Personalized Training in Colleges and Universities are seeking to personalize education even further than the norm via AI educators. The second and most important part of creating an AI is the execution. If you talk the talk, you better make sure your AI can walk the walk. To do this, the designers of these AIs look at what has worked and what has not in education and have taught AI how to differentiate between the two, ensuring that these AIs will be a success. 

# When it comes to data security, the amount of data present in this world is immense and hard to take care of. Imagine if you had trillions of dollars and were expected to keep all of it perfectly safe and secure, it isn’t possible, but it is possible to improve certain systems in machine learning and AI to improve said security. All of our information is accessible on the internet, so it is important that the fields of AI and machine learning are adapted and improved to learn to defend data. We’ve had identity theft issues in my family before, and it is not a fun thing to go through. The last article even goes as far to say that the security of data is a human rights issue. This is an issue that has only gained relevancy in the last twenty to thirty years or so. These articles listed below go into a much further depth of exploration when it comes to the methods of improving AI and machine learning for the benefit of our security.
